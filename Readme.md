# tinyexpr-rs

> A tiny, composable math expression evaluator with AST support, inspired by the C library `tinyexpr`.

## âœ¨ Long term goals

- Lightweight math expression parsing
- Functional-style API: immutable `Context`
- Variables, constants, and user-defined functions
- AST-based, re-usable expression trees
- Wasm friendly?!? Maybe

## âœ¨ Current Features

- Safe, no `unsafe` code
- Variables via `Context`
- Math functions: `sin(x)`, `sqrt(x)`, `max(a, b)`, etc.

## ðŸ“¦ Install

```toml
tinyexpr_rs = "0.1"
```
